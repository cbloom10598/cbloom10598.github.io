Over the last two decades, the study of interaction desgin has taken off with the concept on how humans interact with daily objects around them and aopply it to computer desgin. Ever since computers started to become more personal and everyday people were buying computers or other techniological products, people in the industy had to study on how a person on a philosophical level how a person is able to interact the everyday objects around them and apply those findings on creating a computer interaction design. This is geared at studying simple events as turning on a lightbulb in a room or using the door knob to open the door to get into the house. The overall process looks simple but the science behind it is a bit more complex.

The first question to ask when approaching interaction desgin is what makes a productive interative in the first place? This can be led to several ideas but the simplest form of a interactive product is by touch or a switch. One example of this is a lamp that requires a person to touch the swithc to turn on the light but also touch the switch again to turn the light off. It can also lead to the mose complex forms like clicking the run button on a mouse to start a computer program. However, the product needs to be operational to be called interactive. Even if the lamp was unplugged, it would not be called interactive because the light would not turn on and you would just have a switch that does not do anything. To call a productive with interactive, it must be able to complete the tasks with just interaction by the human and to make sure that the devices is powered on.

The technical details on how designers can create an interatice product is to regonize how the human brain interprets interacting a product by using different "proceesors." We will walk through the setps using the lighbulb method. The first process of the human brain is the perceptual processor that through their eyes see that the room is dark and needs to turn the light on. From there, the cognitive processor intrprets the request and is able to find/give instruction on how to turn the light on which in return, send signals to the motor processor that will make the human have the physical action of turning on the switch. Why is this is important for designers to create interactive product desgins is because knowing how the human processes the interaction of a product is able to create more user freidnly products. Computers use to be all on terminals which had a complex interaction with humans, but as soon as computers developed graphic design, products are able to become user freindly to may people and the philosophical understanding of how a human interacts can create a more useful product to the human. Having that scientific perspective leads to more sophisticated dsesigns with the human skills in mind.
